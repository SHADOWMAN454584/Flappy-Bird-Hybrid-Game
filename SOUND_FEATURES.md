## Technical Implementation

### Sound Initialization
```python
# In Game.__init__():
try:
    self.jump_sound = SoundGenerator.generate_jump_sound()
    self.score_sound = SoundGenerator.generate_score_sound()
    self.game_over_sound = SoundGenerator.generate_game_over_sound()
    self.shooter_gun_sound = SoundGenerator.generate_shooter_gun_sound()
    self.sounds_enabled = True
except:
    self.sounds_enabled = False
```

### Sound Playback
```python
# Jump in Flappy Bird mode:
if self.sounds_enabled:
    self.jump_sound.play()

# Shoot in Zombie Shooter mode:
if self.sounds_enabled:
    self.shooter_gun_sound.play()

# Game over (both modes):
if self.sounds_enabled:
    self.game_over_sound.play()
```
