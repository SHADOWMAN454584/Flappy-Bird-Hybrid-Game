# 🐛 Bug Fixes Summary

## Date: October 7, 2025

### Critical Bugs Fixed

#### 1. **JSON Duplicate Key Bug** ❌ → ✅
**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**Location:** `player_data.json`  
**Issue:** All player records had duplicate `"4"` keys in both `high_scores` and `games_played` dictionaries

**Problem:**
```json
"high_scores": {
  "1": 19,
  "2": 13,
  "3": 6,
  "4": 0,  // First value
  "4": 0   // Duplicate - overwrites first!
}
```

**Impact:**
- JSON parsing would only keep the last value
- Level 4 (Fantastic) scores could be lost or corrupted
- Player statistics would be inaccurate
- Potential data integrity issues

**Fix:**
- Removed all duplicate `"4"` keys across all 13 player records
- Maintained correct Level 4 scores where they existed
- Ensured JSON structure integrity

**Result:** All player data now properly tracks Level 4 scores ✅

### Minor Improvements

#### 2. **Starting Score Standardization** 
**Location:** `flappy_bird.py` (lines 741 and 1967)  
**Change:** Modified starting score from 6 to 0

**Before:**
```python
self.score = 6  # Starting with 6 points as requested
```

**After:**
```python
self.score = 0  # Standard starting score
```

**Rationale:**
- Standard game behavior expects score to start at 0
- Improves player experience and expectation
- Consistent with typical Flappy Bird gameplay
- Makes score tracking more intuitive

**Impact:** Both initial game start and restart now begin at score 0 ✅

## Files Modified

1. **`player_data.json`**
   - Fixed duplicate JSON keys (13 players affected)
   - Preserved existing high scores
   - Maintained data structure integrity

2. **`flappy_bird.py`**
   - Line 741: Initial score set to 0
   - Line 1967: Restart score set to 0
   - Comments updated for clarity
